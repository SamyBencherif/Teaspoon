# Teaspoon

### The minimal (usable) programming language

Teaspoon is designed to be the easiest language to implement that is also reasonable easy to code in.

For example languages like brainf*** are dead simple to implement, but are obscenely difficult to write code in.
Python or EMScript is quite easy to write code in but obscenely difficult to implement.

Teaspoon is a middle ground.
